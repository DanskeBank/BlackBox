Danske Bank BlackBox algorithmic trading challenge

Hi and welcome to the BlackBox challenge.

The challenge is to write a trading algorithm for a stream of prices. For each price you need to take a decision. The decision you can make are "Buy", "Sell" or "Do Nothing".

You are not allowed to Short-Sell, so "Sell" actions will be ignored until you have done an initial "Buy". In the challenge you are buiying and selling a single stock, you will be judged on your Profit/Loss. Repeated buy or sell orders will be ignored as you can only buy or sell a single stock.

Four languages are supported JavaScript, C# and Java. Sample implementations are provided for each language. Instruction for each language can be found under the language folders.

Submit your code by creating a pull request. If you need help with how to create a pull request, fork, clone or any other GitHub related thing there is an awesome help page [here](https://help.github.com/).

Happy Coding!
